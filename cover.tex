To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my interest in applying to the \applyteam\ team at \applycompany\ as a \applyrole.
With over a decade as a full stack engineer, several years of backend focused work, and a track record for
mentoring and growing top talent, I believe I would be a valuable asset to not only the team, but the
organization as a whole.

During my years at BlueCross BlueShield of TN and HealthcareSource, I was instrumental as a full stack
engineer. With active involvment with the product teams, I was able to not only hone my technical skills,
but also learn how to balance engineering and business needs.

As my career progressed, I began to focus on the pure engineering challenges afforded to backend development.
I've excelled at leading and maintaining 3rd party integrations, full redesigns of asynchronous job systems,
and various other backend projects. The majority of my tenure at ThirtyMadison involved working on platform
teams where my work was entirely backend focused. This culminated as I accepted the role of leading the
company's Architecture Review Group.

At Vikus, I began on a three person team, but over the next few years, we grew it to seven. With the hiring 
of two new graduates, I thoroughly enjoyed mentoring and growing their technical skills. Every opportunity
I've been given to nurture and grow other engineers continually prove to be highlights in my career.

It is with excitement that I submit my application to \applycompany. I know my experience as a
full stack and backend engineer, and my skill as mentor sets me apart. Please see my attached resume and
letters of recommendation on LinkedIn for more details. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward
to meeting and discussing with you how best I could join and contribute to your organization.

\hfill \break
Sincerely,\\
\name
